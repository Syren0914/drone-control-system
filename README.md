# 🛸 Drone Control System

Welcome to our open-source Arduino-based drone project! This repository contains all code and documentation for both the **transmitter** and **receiver** using **Arduino Nano** and **NRF24L01 modules**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

We are a student team building a remote-controlled drone from scratch. This system enables stable flight using real-time joystick input via radio transmission.

---

## 🧠 Features

- NRF24L01-based wireless communication (transmitter/receiver)
- Manual control via joysticks
- PWM-based motor control through ESCs
- Modular codebase for easy updates
- Future support for sensors (e.g., gyroscope, barometer)
